* Optimizations on allocated heap memory ([2768bd1](https://github.com/fovea-org/fovea/commit/2768bd1))

## [1.0.132](https://github.com/fovea-org/fovea/compare/v1.0.131...v1.0.132) (2018-09-20)


### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the CLI wouldn't generate a package.json that depended on [@fovea](https://github.com/fovea)/lib ([f4d7b90](https://github.com/fovea-org/fovea/commit/f4d7b90))
* Fixed an issue with taking variables which pointed to CSS Custom Properties with default values. The new behavior makes sure to actually use the default value in JSON output. ([fb87897](https://github.com/fovea-org/fovea/commit/fb87897))


### Features

* Added better runtime logging for when an already declared Custom Element or Custom Attribute is attempted to be defined. Fixes [#24](https://github.com/fovea-org/fovea/issues/24) ([be25025](https://github.com/fovea-org/fovea/commit/be25025))
* Made transition durations and timing functions themeable in [@fovea](https://github.com/fovea)/material ([b32ed55](https://github.com/fovea-org/fovea/commit/b32ed55))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* The button Custom Attribute in @fovea/material is now a proper custom element to enhance interoperability.
