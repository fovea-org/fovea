## [1.0.132](https://github.com/fovea-org/fovea/compare/v1.0.131...v1.0.132) (2018-09-20)


### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a few remaining issues with taking variables inside [@fovea](https://github.com/fovea)/styles ([9da4192](https://github.com/fovea-org/fovea/commit/9da4192))
* Fixed an issue where the CLI wouldn't generate a package.json that depended on [@fovea](https://github.com/fovea)/common. This would break hoisted dependencies in hoisted monorepos ([f4d21a0](https://github.com/fovea-org/fovea/commit/f4d21a0))
* Fixed an issue where the CLI wouldn't generate a package.json that depended on [@fovea](https://github.com/fovea)/lib ([f4d7b90](https://github.com/fovea-org/fovea/commit/f4d7b90))
* Fixed an issue with radio buttons in [@fovea](https://github.com/fovea)/material. Improved docs ([0aba61a](https://github.com/fovea-org/fovea/commit/0aba61a))
* Fixed an issue with taking variables which pointed to CSS Custom Properties with default values. The new behavior makes sure to actually use the default value in JSON output. ([fb87897](https://github.com/fovea-org/fovea/commit/fb87897))
* Fixed performance issues with debouncing and lazily evaluating certain things in [@fovea](https://github.com/fovea)/material ([10bd7e5](https://github.com/fovea-org/fovea/commit/10bd7e5))


### Features

* .[sass|scss] files can now [@import](https://github.com/import) from node_modules with the '~' prefix using the node resolution algorithm. ([10fa8a2](https://github.com/fovea-org/fovea/commit/10fa8a2))
* Abstract classes that directly or indirectly derives from HTMLElement will no longer auto-generate calls to customElements.define or customAttributes.define since these are not constructable and meant for subclassing. Fixes [#27](https://github.com/fovea-org/fovea/issues/27) ([f3b1168](https://github.com/fovea-org/fovea/commit/f3b1168))
* Made icon-button-components compatible with forms with the 'button' role ([053ce34](https://github.com/fovea-org/fovea/commit/053ce34))
* Made the base font size themeable in [@fovea](https://github.com/fovea)/material ([3ce8e9f](https://github.com/fovea-org/fovea/commit/3ce8e9f))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* The button Custom Attribute in @fovea/material is now a proper custom element to enhance interoperability.
